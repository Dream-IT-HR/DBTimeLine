DBCreator only deploys revisions which are not already deployed. 
- If these new revisions change database objects which are different in production than in source, then those database objects will be overwriten, and only those. 
- The rest of manual changes to production database are irrelevant to DBCreator and will not be overwriten.
- This feature allows DBCreator to continue existing database version control without the need of scripting current database structure.
- With DBCreator, all you need is start using it.

CreateTimeLine
- database structure and data are both part of DBCreator revision timeline

Capture current database structure
- querying ddl views DBCreator generates its own modules on bases of captured database structure
- these captures can be saved directly in the database or in standalone .cs, .sql files
- this allows legacy issues to be completely removed
- it is also possible to deploy these captures to new databases which makes setting up production environment for new clients painless

- code generation possible on multiple databases simultaneously, DBCreator automaticaly finds identical dbObject and puts differences in separate files

Plugins
- DBCreator uses plugins for custom changes in a way that each database knows what it needs installed
- no need for external config files or something similar
